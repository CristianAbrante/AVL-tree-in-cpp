# AVL-tree-in-cpp

Implementation of the Adelson-Velskii &amp; Landis (AVL) balanced tree 
in the C++ programming language for academic purposes. If you want to 
see further information check [the report](doc/report.pdf).

## Getting Started

For running the program in your local machine you must have `cmake` 
installed, and then check out the following steps.

### Installing

For use the the program first you have to clone the current repository.

```[bash]
$ git clone https://github.com/CristianAbrante/AVL-tree-in-cpp.git
$ cd AVL-tree-in-cpp
```
and then build the project with the `cmake` command.

```[bash]
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
```

## Running the program

After building the program, you can execute the program with:

```
./AVLTree.out
```

The main menu of the application is:

```
---------------- Práctica 6 : Árbol Binario de Búsqueda Balanceado--------------- 

Use arrows keys to go up or down.
Press Enter to choose an option.

[X] Modo demostración
[ ] Modo Estadística
```

If you want to use the application use the arrow keys. 

As you can see there are two main options:

* **Demonstration mode**: It is used to visualize the AVL Tree.
* **Statistics mode**: It performs an statistical study of the tree.
